Difference-in-Differences beyond Ideal Conditions: Methods for Evaluating Municipal Education Policies in São Paulo City

Abstract
This paper examines the association between Unified Educational Centers (Centros Educacionais Unificados – CEUs) and elementary school dropout in the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil, using difference-in-differences (DiD) methods applied under non-ideal empirical conditions. CEUs are a large-scale, place-based education and social policy implemented in socioeconomically vulnerable areas, characterized by non-random placement, staggered adoption, heterogeneous implementation, and overlap with concurrent policies. Using publicly available administrative and statistical data from São Paulo City Hall, the analysis follows a two-step strategy. An exploratory DiD assessment examines long-run territorial changes using the Municipal Human Development Index, followed by a core analysis of annual elementary school dropout at the subprefecture level from 2000 to 2021. Across conservative specifications, subprefectures exposed to CEUs exhibit larger declines in dropout, with estimated reductions of approximately 30 to 90 students per year relative to non-exposed areas. While not interpreted as definitive causal effects, these magnitudes are meaningful relative to observed variation in dropout. Methodologically, the paper illustrates the use of DiD as a diagnostic tool in complex municipal policy environments.
